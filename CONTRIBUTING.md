# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this project.

## Guidelines

-   Follow Clean Architecture boundaries.
-   Keep handlers idempotent.
-   Do not break delivery semantics (at-least-once).
-   Add unit and integration tests for new features.
-   Update documentation when modifying behavior.

## Commit Convention

Use conventional commits:

-   feat: new feature
-   fix: bug fix
-   docs: documentation
-   chore: maintenance
-   test: testing updates

## Pull Requests

-   Clearly describe the change.
-   Reference related ADR if architectural.
-   Ensure tests pass before submitting.
